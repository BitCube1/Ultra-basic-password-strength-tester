Ultra basic password strength tester

This is a VERY basic strength-tester of passwords. It's only based on length for now. Will add checkers such as whether or not the password contains both capitalized and lower case letters, if it contains numbers and if it contains any special characters as these also increases password strength based on the research I've done so far.

Here you can see whatever sources I used to get the information about password strength that i based the script on.
